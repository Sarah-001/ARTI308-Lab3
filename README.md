Lab 3: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

# Project Title
Diabetes Data Analysis

# Description
This project uses Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to study a diabetes dataset from Kaggle.
The dataset has medical data that can help understand if a person may have diabetes.

# Dataset
The dataset includes health information such as Glucose level, Blood Pressure, BMI, Insulin level, and Age.
Each row represents one patient.
These features describe the health condition of the patient and help us study diabetes risk.

## Key Columns and Descriptions:

• Pregnancies: Number of times the patient has been pregnant
• Glucose: Plasma glucose concentration a 2 hours in an oral glucose tolerance test(blood sugar level)
• BloodPressure: Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)
• SkinThickness: Triceps skin fold thickness (mm)
• Insulin: 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml)
• BMI: Body Mass Index (weight in kg/(height in m)²)
• DiabetesPedigreeFunction: Diabetes hereditary function (genetic risk score)
• Age: Age of the patient (years)
• Outcome: Target variable (0 = No diabetes, 1 = Diabetes)

# Tools Used

Pandas
